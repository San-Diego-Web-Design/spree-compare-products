## Compare Products

Provides product comparison with other products with the same taxon.

### FEATURES

* Allows the user to select which taxonomies are comparable


### TODO

* Should only allow products comparison in comparable taxonomies
* Should only compare products in the same exact taxon
* Should provide a bookmark-able URL
* Should compare up to 4 products
* Should redirect to the product's taxon page if only one product is provided
* Should not rely on javascript
* Should use javascript (if available) to:
  * Alert when more than 4 products are selected
  * Alert when just 1 product submitted
  * Submit to the correct URL (to avoid server-side redirection)
